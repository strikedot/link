I'm 15, and I'm good at computers.
I created Twentycent (<a href="http://www.twentycent.art">http://www.twentycent.art</a>, <a href="http://long.twentyecnt.art">click here if the page dosen't work</a>), a <a href="https://cse.google.com">Google CSE</a>-based search engine.
Twentycent "grew":
- first on SiteW (version 1.0 to 1.1.1; http://sitew.com)
- second on Wix (version 2.0; http://wix.com)
- third on Google Sites — before, I thought it cost money, because of GSuite (now Google WorkSpace) — (version 3.0
to 3.3.1-a; HTTPS://sites.google.com)
Twentycent is now 100% made by me and the visual aspect is inspired by (and looks like) Google, but IS NOT Google,
although I would love to do a collaboration with them [reference > <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ooxgoo/post
